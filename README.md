<h1>Hello everyone <span style='font-size:100px;'>&#9996;</span></h1>

I'm a mechatronic engineer, with some experience in the field of automation and robotics.
What motivated me to get a specialization in this field was my interest in
robotics during my university years.
Nevertheless, during my first years of work, I've also developed a strong curiosity towards tech and computer science world.
